# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

We helped Seth and Tom to get the election audit results by using the Python script. The main purpose of this analysis is to find out the winner of the election. Further, we also need some other information about results such as the winner candidate, each candidate's vote percentage, and results of each county's total votes cast. Finally, we want a faster and printed text file to send to the election commission.

## Results

- [**Total Votes:**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11LjZ1zAqa6jvto3hLIca0IFRQLdp3WMN/view?usp=sharing)

	First, there were 369,711 total were cast during these congressional elections.

- [**County wise results:**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m812hxawT5sZCFQox0iT_R8sjQTFBkBL/view?usp=sharing)

	Denver was the largest turnout county with 82.8% (306,055) of total votes cast in the election. Jefferson County's vote percentage was 10.5%. In the election, Arapahoe County had the smallest percentage of votes cast, which is only 6.7% of the total. 

- [**Candidate wise results:**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IiMWBEw90qeiueCBlPA6eQT6HpLMUYpJ/view?usp=sharing)

**Diana DeGette** won these elections with the highest vote percentage, which is 73.8% and received 272,892 votes in total. Charles Casper Stockham was in second position with 23% (85,213) votes and Raymon Anthony Doane lost the elections as well as he received only 3.1% (11,606) votes in total. 

## Summary

From the results we can analyze that this script performed very well to provide us with the clear results of the congressional election. Moreover, with some modifications, this script can be used in different types of elections. 

- First, if we want to use the same script for presidential elections, the counties can be changed to state. That way we can determine the contribution of each state in elections in the same manner as counties. 

- Secondaly, we can make the code a little longer and design it with some if-statements; in the beginning. That way we can ask the user what type of elections we are checking with this script. That way the same code can be used over and over to get results without changing the code every time.
